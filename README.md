# Atraídos (Project Passion Fruit)

> "And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself." — John 12:32

## 🎯 The Vision
This repository is the central digital hub for **Comunidade Cristã Atraídos Pela Cruz**. 

The project code-name is **Passion Fruit** (Maracujá). Historically, the Passion Fruit flower was named by missionaries to represent the instruments of the Cross (the "Passion"). Just as the flower points to the Cross and the fruit provides sweetness and nourishment, this platform is designed to:

* **Attract:** Create a digital "aroma" that draws people to the message of the Cross.
* **Nourish:** Provide resources, teachings, and community connection.
* **Cluster:** Like the seeds within a single fruit, we are many members held together in one Body.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Core Goals
This repository manages the web presence, community management tools, and outreach resources for our congregation.
